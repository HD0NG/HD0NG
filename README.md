# Hi there 👋, I'm Haoyang (Max)

🎓 PhD Student @ University of Eastern Finland (UEF)  
🔬 Research focus: **Solar Energy • LiDAR Data • Point Cloud Processing**  
🐀 Rat dad to four curious explorers  

---

## 🌞 What I Do
- Modeling solar energy potential with LiDAR data
- Roof segmentation using **Point-U-Net** and related deep learning models
- Physically-based LiDAR ray tracing (Beer–Lambert law, voxel/octree methods)
- Exploring clustering methods & waveform correction

---

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- GIS & Remote Sensing (LiDAR, PDAL, CloudCompare, MATLAB)  
- Data science workflows, visualization, and modeling  

---

## 📚 Current Project
Working on the **HARVEST Project** 🌱:  
> Developing accurate methods to model solar energy potential in built environments using LiDAR-based techniques.

---

## ✨ Fun Facts
- Based in Finland (Helsinki ↔ Kuopio commute life)  
- Usually seen debugging code with coffee in one hand and a rat on the desk  
- Enjoy thoughtful conversations on research, planning, and even human behavior
